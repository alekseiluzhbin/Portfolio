The World Health Organization (WHO)â€™s Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository
tracks life expectancy for countries worldwide by following health status
and many other related factors.

This dataset covers a variety of indicators for all countries from 2000 to 2015 including:
-immunization factors
-mortality factors
-economic factors
-social factors
-other health-related factors

Life expectancy is expressed in years, and hence it is a number.
This means that in order to build a predictive model one needs to use regression.
