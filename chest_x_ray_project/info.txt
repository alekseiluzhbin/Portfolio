We will be using the Chest X-Ray (Pneumonia) dataset:
approximately 6000 chest x-rays, each annotated as ‘NORMAL’ or ‘PNEUMONIA.’

Our goal is to pass these X-ray images into our Convolutional Neural Network,
and to classify them according to their respective labels.

data/train (data/test) is a folder that contains two subfolders:
- NORMAL : Chest x-rays of patients without pneumonia.
- PNEUMONIA : Chest x-rays of patients with pneumonia.

A ROC curve gives us the relationship between our true positive rate and our false positive rate.
A true positive would be correctly identifying a patient with Pneumonia,
while a false positive would be incorrectly identifying a healthy person as having pneumonia.
