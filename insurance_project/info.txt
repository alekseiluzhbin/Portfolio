Let’s take a look at the Medical Cost Personal Datasets dataset:

We would like to predict the individual medical costs (charges) given the rest of the columns/features.
Since charges represent continuous values (in dollars), we’re performing a regression task.

Hyperparameter tuning: epochs with early stopping.
The number of epochs is a hyperparameter representing the number of complete passes through the training dataset.
Too many epochs can lead to overfitting, and too few to underfitting.
One trick is to use early stopping: when the training performance reaches the plateau or starts degrading, the learning stops.

Baseline.
A baseline result is the simplest possible prediction.
Baselines give us an idea of whether our model has a reasonable performance.
Since we are focused on a regression task, we can use averages or medians of the class distribution known as central tendency measures as the result for all predictions.

The result of the baseline is $9,190, and we definitely did better than this: around $3,000.
