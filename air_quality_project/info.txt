We will be working with the air_quality_train.csv and air_quality_test.csv data sets.

We will create a Keras Sequential classification model in TensorFlow that will predict the air quality
dependent on the different element compounds found in the air (e.g. Carbon monoxide, Benzene).

The label column is Air_Quality and has the following scale from worst to best air quality:
'Severe', 'Very Poor', 'Poor', 'Moderate', 'Satisfactory', 'Good'.
