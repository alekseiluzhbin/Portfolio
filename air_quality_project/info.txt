We will be working with the data_train.csv and data_test.csv sets.

We will create a Keras Sequential classification model in TensorFlow that will predict the air quality
dependent on the different element compounds found in the air (e.g. Carbon monoxide, Benzene).

The label column is Air_Quality and has the following scale from worst to best air quality:
'Severe', 'Very Poor', 'Poor', 'Moderate', 'Satisfactory', 'Good'.
