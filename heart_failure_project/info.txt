In this project we use a dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data

We will create a Keras Sequential classification model in TensorFlow
to predict the survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine
and ejection fraction, and other factors such as age, anemia, diabetes, and so on.

DEATH_EVENT - the column we need to predict.
