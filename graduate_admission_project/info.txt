By analyzing the parameters in this graduate admissions dataset,
we use TensorFlow with Keras to create a model that can evaluate the chances of an applicant being admitted:

This data provides information about 500 applications for various universities
and what their chance of admittance is. This dataset has nine different columns:
- GRE test score;
- TOEFL test score;
- Evaluated university rating;
- etc.

This is a regression problem because the probability of being admitted is a continuous label between 0 and 1.
