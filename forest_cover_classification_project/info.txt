In this project we use deep learning to predict forest cover type
(the most common kind of tree cover) based only on cartographic variables.
This study area includes four wilderness areas
located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado,
so existing forest cover types are mainly a result of ecological processes
rather than forest management practices.
The actual forest cover type was determined from US Forest Service (USFS).

The covertypes are the following:
-Spruce/Fir
-Lodgepole Pine
-Ponderosa Pine
-Cottonwood/Willow
-Aspen
-Douglas-fir
-Krummholz

The project objective is to develop a classifier for this multi-class classification problem.
