At our disposal, we have a set X-ray lung scans with examples of patients
who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness:

Using the Keras module, we will create a classification model that outputs a diagnosis
based on a patientâ€™s X-ray scan.

The dataset folders are split into train and test folders
and there are three different folders within them:
- Covid
- Normal
- Viral Pneumonia

These are each a different class that our learning model can output,
indicating a multi-class classification problem.

All the X-ray scans are in grayscale.
